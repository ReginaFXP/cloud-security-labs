# Cloud Security Labs

Hands-on cloud security labs focused on protecting infrastructure, identities, and data in cloud environments.  
This repository demonstrates practical security thinking across cloud governance, operations, detection, and DevSecOps.

The work here reflects a background in critical infrastructure compliance and risk management, translated into modern cloud security practices through scripting, automation, and CLI-based workflows.
